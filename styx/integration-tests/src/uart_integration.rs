/// Inputs:
/// - `T`: the concrete processor type to test
/// - `builder`: a function that returns ProcessorBuilder<'static>
///   - the processor builder needs to have the target program, endianness, backend, and architecture defined
/// - `port`: the uart port to connect to
///
/// The target program that the processor is running should do exactly two things.
/// 1. First the target program should send the following message "Hello world.\r\n", including the null byte.
/// 2. Then, the target program should become an echo server, sending back exactly what was received over UART.
///
/// See `data/test-binaries/arm/kinetis_21/twrk21f120m-sdk/boards/twrk21f120m/demo_apps/uart_test/uart_test.c`
///     for an example test program.
///
/// The test itself first builds the processor and a Uart client, making sure that the client is able to connect
/// to the processor.  Next, it waits for the "Hello world.\r\n" message to be sent from the target.  Finally
/// the test generates `Vec<u8>` of several sizes with random data, sends the data and compares the echo against
/// the original to make sure that the message was echoed back exactly.
///
/// Beware:
/// The messages that are sent and echoed by the target program are randomly generated.
