//! Implementation of the `MPC866M` event controller core
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! Compared to the "standard" model of Memory Mapped Registers (MMR's),
//! where each peripheral owns its own memory area, allowing us
//! to just implement [`Peripheral`] and [`Peripheral::init`].
//!
//! This target allows global relocation of the MMR's via writing
//! to the `IMMR` internal register using the `mtspr` instruction.
//!
//! ## Hook Routing
//!
//! This changes how we organize the normal tree of peripherals and
//! hooks by passing the memory hook routing logic from the backend,
//! to the `SystemInterfaceUnit`. The `SystemInterfaceUnit` does
//! two things (in addition to its normal MPC8XX level responsibilities):
//! - hook all instruction executions to watch for global state modifiers
//!   like `mtspr IMMR, <reg>`
//! - change the IMMR bank memory hook as needed, and route the hooks to
//!   the respective rust object
//!

/// IRQs for the MPC866m event controller
///
/// ## Notes
///
/// There are two different type of exceptions; "synchronous", and
/// "asynchronous" (interrupts). Synchronous exceptions are caused due
/// to the processing of an instruction (not by the instruction semantics
/// itself aka manually asserting an interrupt).
///
/// At the machine level, the order in which certain exceptions will be
/// detected is as follows:
///
/// | Order | Exception Enum | Reason |
/// |-------|----------------|--------|
/// | 1  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::Trace`] | Trace bit asserted |
/// | 2  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::InstructionTlbMiss`] | Instruction MMU TLB miss |
/// | 3  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::InstructionTlbError`] | Instruction MMU protection/translation error |
/// | 4  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::MachineCheck`] | Fetch Error |
/// | 5  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::InstructionBreakpoint`] | Match detection |
/// | 6  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::SoftwareEmulation`] | Attempt to invoke unimplemented feature |
/// | 7  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::Program`] or [`Mpc866mIRQn::Alignment`] or [`Mpc866mIRQn::SystemCall`] | This has an internal sub-ordering: Attempting to execute a privileged instruction, Alignment - Load/Store checking, System call - `sc` instruction, `trap` - trap instruction |
/// | 8  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::DataTlbMiss`] | Data TLB miss |
/// | 9  | [`Mpc866mIRQn::DataTlbError`] | Data TLB Error |
/// | 10 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::MachineCheck`] | Load or Store access error
/// | 11 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::DataBreakpoint`] or [`Mpc866mIRQn::PeripheralBreakpoint`] | Match Detection |
///
/// When multiple exception conditions exist, the highest should be taken, in this ordering:
///
/// | Priority | Exception Type | Reason |
/// |----------|----------------|--------|
/// | 1 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::NonmaskableDevelopmentPort`] | Signal from development port |
/// | 2 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::SystemReset`] | `IRQ0` assertion |
/// | 3 | Synchronous Exceptions (see above)  | Instruction Processing |
/// | 4 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::PeripheralBreakpoint`] or [`Mpc866mIRQn::NonmaskableDevelopmentPort`] | Breakpoint signal from any peripheral |
/// | 5 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::External`] | Signal from the interrupt controller |
/// | 6 | [`Mpc866mIRQn::Decrementer`] | Decrementer request |
