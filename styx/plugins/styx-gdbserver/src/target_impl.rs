//! Defines [`TargetImpl`] and implements gdbstub `Target` traits for multi-thread debugging.
//!
//! [`TargetImpl`] sits between [`gdbstub`] and the [`CpuBackend`]
//! to control cpu execution and the various `gdbstub` trait implementations
//! found in this module.
//!
//! The [`TargetImpl`] traits are essentially a collection of handlers invoked by the _gdb
//! client_ over the gdb serial protocol. The gdbstub uses a technique called
//! _Inlineable Dynamic Extension Traits_ (_IDETs_) to expose the interface
//! to the GDB protocol.
//!
//! See
//! [_Implementing Target_](https://docs.rs/gdbstub/0.7.3/gdbstub/target/index.html#implementing-target)
//! for an explanation, see `support_breakpoints` in the source for an example.
//!
//! There is also discussion
//! [`here`](https://github.com/daniel5151/inlinable-dyn-extension-traits/blob/master/writeup.md)
//!
//! ## Multiprocessor Considerations
//! gdbstub contains a sister set of target extensions for multithread
//! specifically in `gdbstub::target::ext::base`.
//!
//! We represent each vcpu as a gdb thread (`Tid`). The mapping can be found
//! in [`super::event_loop::index_to_tid()`]. The mapping is simple, just
//! that `Tid`'s are 1 indexed. In this crate thread and vcpu core will be used
//! interchangeably.
//!
//! When breaking a single thread we must consider what happens to the other threads.
//! The default mode in gdb (and the only supported mode in gdbstub) is **all-stop mode**.
//! As you may be able to guess, when a threads stops in all-stop mode, all the other
//! threads stop with it.
//!
//! Documentation for all-stop mode can be found at <https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/All_002dStop-Mode.html>.
//!
//! When a thread is resumed in all-stop mode, all other threads should continue until a thread stops again, either because
//! it was stepped or it hit another breakpoint.
//!
//! **NOTE**: Technically thread behavior on resume is determined by
//! the `scheduler-locking` option. Styx's gdbserver implements the required
//! gdbstub trait (MultiThreadSchedulerLocking) but this silently does nothing
//! and all threads will continue no matter this option. We implement this because
//! gdbstub's behavior is to fatally error if gdb sets `scheduler-lock on` if the `TargetImpl`
//! doesn't implement MultiThreadSchedulerLocking.
//!
//! In styx, we simplify a little bit. Since we execute round robin style,
//! the other threads are not being executed in parallel. Instead, if any thread is stepping
//! then we step all other threads as well (instead of continuing).
