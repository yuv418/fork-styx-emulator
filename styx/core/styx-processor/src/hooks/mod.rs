//! Hooks for the Styx emulator.
//!
//! Hooks are the means for peripherals, plugins, MMUs, and users to act on common processor events
//! as they happen, as well as influence execution of the processor.
//!
//! Hooks can be added to structs implementing the [`Hookable`] trait, most notably, the
//! [`CpuBackend`] trait requires a [`Hookable`] implementation.
//!
//! # Hooks API
//!
//! Hooks are added via the [`Hookable`] trait. The core behavior is a single [`Hookable::add_hook()`]
//! function that takes the [`StyxHook`] enum representing the new hook object and the address range
//! it is triggered by (if applicable). [`Hookable`] also provides helper functions such as
//! [`Hookable::code_hook()`] as shorthands for adding specific hook types.
//!
//! The preferred method for constructing [`StyxHook`] is using the method constructions e.g.
//! [`StyxHook::code()`], [`StyxHook::memory_write()`], etc. These are ergonomic constructors that take
//! rust ranges and any object that impls the correct hook callback trait.
//! Consult the [`StyxHook`] documentation for detailed information on constructing hooks.
//!
//! [`AddHookError::HookTypeNotSupported`] returned from attempting to add a hook, [`Hookable`]
//! implementers can choose to reject hooks if they are not supported.
//!
//! Each type of hook is defined by a trait with a `call` function. Each call function is passed a
//! mutable reference to the core trinity ([`CoreHandle`]: see more [`crate::core`]) as well as any
//! parameters custom to the hook type. Additionally, the call is give a mut reference to itself
//! allowing the hook to carry mutable state between calls.
//!
//! Each hook type is blanket implemented for the FnMut signature that applies to its call function
//! allowing users to pass a closure or function with appropriate signature as a hook without having
//! to manually impl the trait.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! # use styx_processor::processor::{ProcessorBuilder, Processor};
//! # use styx_processor::core::builder::DummyProcessorBuilder;
//! # use styx_errors::UnknownError;
//! use styx_processor::hooks::{StyxHook, CoreHandle, CodeHook};
//!
//! // a simple function with the correct signature is a good way to define a hook
//!
//! // code hook that prints the pc where it got called
//! fn fn_code_hook(mut proc: CoreHandle) -> Result<(), UnknownError> {
//!     // access execution state, use ? to propagate errors
//!     let pc = proc.pc()?;
//!     println!("function code hook hit @ 0x{pc:X}");
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! // a closure will also work
//! let closure_code_hook = move |proc: CoreHandle| {
//!     println!("closure code hook hit");
//!     Ok(())
//! };
//!
//! // hook callbacks are represented by traits so custom structs with state work too
//! #[derive(Default)]
//! struct HitCountCodeHook {
//!     times_hit: u32
//! }
//! impl CodeHook for HitCountCodeHook {
//!     fn call(&mut self, proc: CoreHandle) -> Result<(), UnknownError> {
//!         self.times_hit += 1;
//!         println!("hit, total: {}", self.times_hit);
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let builder = ProcessorBuilder::default()
//!     .with_builder(DummyProcessorBuilder)
//!     .add_hook(StyxHook::code(0x1234, HitCountCodeHook::default())) // only triggered on 0x1234
//!     .add_hook(StyxHook::code(0x1000..=0x2000, fn_code_hook)) // use rust ranges
//!     .add_hook(StyxHook::code(.., closure_code_hook)); // even unbounded ranges
//! ```

/// Enum containing all possible hooks on a Styx cpu.
///
/// There are three types of hook.
///
/// 1. **Address hooks** that trigger on an operation within a range of
///    addresses
///
/// 2. **Register hooks** that trigger on an operation to a specific register.
///
/// 3. **Event hooks** that trigger indiscriminately when an event happens
///
/// All hooks return a [Result] with [styx_errors::UnknownError] error type. An
/// Err variant returned from a hook will be propagated as a fatal error.
///
/// ## Callback Construction
/// ### Quick and Dirty
/// Box a function with the correct args.
///
/// ```
/// use styx_processor::hooks::{CoreHandle, StyxHook};
/// use styx_processor::memory::helpers::ReadExt;
/// use styx_errors::UnknownError;
///
/// fn my_memory_read_hook(proc: CoreHandle, address: u64, size: u32, data: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(), UnknownError> {
///     // overwrite data with memory at 0x100.
///     // ? will propagate memory error as fatal
///     proc.mmu.data().read(0x100).bytes(data)?;
///     Ok(())
/// }
///
/// // preferred ergonomic method construction
/// let styx_hook = StyxHook::memory_read(0x1000, my_memory_read_hook);
/// // concrete variant construction
/// let styx_hook = StyxHook::MemoryRead(0x1000.into(), Box::new(my_memory_read_hook));
/// ```
///
/// ### Address Ranges
/// Hooks use a specialized [`AddressRange`] to represent the ranges of
/// addresses that the hook should trigger on. the method syntax (i.e.
/// [`StyxHook::code()`]) will convert compatible Into [`AddressRange`] for you.
/// See the example below for different ways to specify addressing.
///
/// ```
/// use styx_processor::hooks::{CoreHandle, StyxHook};
/// use styx_errors::UnknownError;
///
/// fn my_hook(mut proc: CoreHandle) -> Result<(), UnknownError> {
///     Ok(())
/// }
///
/// // single address (u64) — triggers only on 0x1000
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(0x1000, my_hook);
///
/// // exclusive range (Range) — triggers on 0x1000..0x2000 (0x1FFF is last)
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(0x1000..0x2000, my_hook);
///
/// // inclusive range (RangeInclusive) — triggers on 0x1000..=0x2000 (0x2000 is last)
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(0x1000..=0x2000, my_hook);
///
/// // unbounded start (RangeTo) — triggers on all addresses below 0x2000
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(..0x2000, my_hook);
///
/// // unbounded start, inclusive end (RangeToInclusive)
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(..=0x2000, my_hook);
///
/// // unbounded end (RangeFrom) — triggers on 0x1000 and all addresses above
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(0x1000.., my_hook);
///
/// // fully unbounded (RangeFull) — triggers on every address
/// let hook = StyxHook::code(.., my_hook);
/// ```
///
/// ### Detailed Use
/// Hook callbacks are defined by unique traits (e.g. [`CodeHook`]). Each
/// trait has a `call()` function that takes a [`CoreHandle`] and hook specific
/// parameters and returns a Result. Additionally, each handle has a trait as
/// an impl for a `FnMut` of the correct parameters. This is what allows the
/// closure construction in the example above.
///
/// ### NOTE
/// Orderings of multiple hooks executing on the same address are `undefined`
/// and cannot be relied upon.
///
/// See individual variants' documentation for specifics on their API
/// guarantees.
