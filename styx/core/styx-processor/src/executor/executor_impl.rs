/// The common interface that all executor implementations need to support.
///
/// Add to a processor using
/// [`ProcessorBuilder::with_executor()`](crate::processor::ProcessorBuilder::with_executor()).
///
/// Implementing this trait allows executors to decide how many instructions, to emulate at a time,
/// when to handle events, when to update the state of peripherals, and when to stop emulation.
///
/// Both `halt_emulation` and `post_stride_processing` take a [`Delta`] representing the number of
/// instructions and wall clock time elapsed during execution. Note that `Delta::time` is wall
/// clock time (real-world duration), not any processor-specific or simulated time. It's
/// recommended to forward this to the `tick` events in the event controller, peripherals, and
/// plugins, but an [`ExecutorImpl`] can choose to modify this to change the speed of time.
///
/// ## Included Executors
///
/// A list of [`ExecutorImpl`] included in standard Styx.
///
/// - [`DefaultExecutor`](crate::executor::DefaultExecutor)
/// - [`ConditionalExecutor:lExecutorutor`](crate::executor::ConditionalExecutor)
/// - [`SingleStepExecutor`](crate::executor::SingleStepExecutor)
///
/// ## Execution Behavior
///
/// Below is an overview of the executor loop.
///
/// 0. [`ProcessorBuilder::build()`](crate::processor::ProcessorBuilder::build()) calls
///    `ExecutorImpl::init()` to initialize its state. This is only called once on processor
///    construction.
/// 1. [`Processor::run()`](crate::processor::Processor::run()) is called to start emulation, this
///    calls `Executor::begin()` and gives control of the [`ProcessorCore`] and [`Plugins`] to the
///    `Executor`.
/// 2. The number of instructions per tick cycle (aka the `stride length`) is found by calling
///    [`ExecutorImpl::get_stride_length()`].
///     - Note that this only happens on the call to start/begin and is not rerun between strides.
/// 3. [`ExecutorImpl::emulation_setup()`] is called. This should call `processor_start()` on the
///    event controller, peripherals, and plugins.
/// 4. The emulation loop is entered. First in the emulation loop,
///    [`ExecutorImpl::valid_emulation_conditions()`] is checked.
/// 5. [`ExecutorImpl::emulate()`] is called. This should call `proc.cpu.execute()`.
/// 6. [`ExecutorImpl::halt_emulation()`] is called with the cpu's [`TargetExitReason`] and the
///    amount of [`Delta`] time spent emulating.
/// 7. [`ExecutorImpl::post_stride_processing()`] is called. This should call `tick()` and `next()`
///    methods.
/// 8. Finally, the execution constraints are checked and emulation exits if either are met.
/// 9. This loop (starting at `4.`) continues until something indicates the processor should stop.
///    After which, [`ExecutorImpl::emulation_teardown()`] is called. There is `processor_stop()`
///    should be called.
///
/// [`ExecutorImpl`] implementations should call `tick()`, `next()`, `processor_start()`, and
/// `processor_stop()` in the correct places to avoid unexpected behaviors. Check the default method
/// code for the [`ExecutorImpl`] methods to see how this is done. You can also use
/// `test::test_executor_events()` to verify your
/// [`ExecutorImpl`] calls all of the required events.
///
