/// Executor that fully owns the execution loop.
///
/// Unlike [`StrideExecutor`](super::StrideExecutor) which participates in the built-in
/// stride-based loop, a `CustomExecutor` is given full control over how and when instructions
/// are executed. This is appropriate for tools that need to drive execution themselves, such as
/// debuggers and fuzzers.
///
/// The [`Executor`](super::Executor) still handles calling `processor_start` / `processor_stop`
/// lifecycle events on plugins and event controllers before and after
/// [`CustomExecutor::execute()`]. The custom executor is responsible for:
///
/// - Calling [`post_stride_processing`](super::post_stride_processing) (or equivalent) after
///   each vCPU stride to process per-vCPU events.
/// - Calling [`EventDistributor::tick()`](crate::event_controller::EventDistributor::tick)
///   to tick peripherals and route interrupts. For stride-based execution this
///   happens once per round; custom executors should call it at a cadence
///   appropriate to their use case.
/// - Updating time accounting:
///   [`vcpu.time.record_stride(&report, stride, wall)`](super::time::VcpuTime::record_stride)
///   after each per-vCPU `cpu.execute` call, and
///   [`core.time.advance(stride)`](super::time::ProcessorTime::advance) once per
///   round before constructing the
///   [`GlobalDelta`](super::time::GlobalDelta) passed to `EventDistributor::tick`.
///   Ghost-advancing exited vCPUs (i.e. calling `advance_simulated` without
///   running the backend) is the executor's responsibility if the round-boundary
///   invariant is to be preserved for them.
///
/// ## When to use
///
/// Use `CustomExecutor` when you need to:
/// - Interleave execution with external I/O (e.g. a GDB client)
/// - Run execution in a loop controlled by an external framework (e.g. a fuzzer harness)
/// - Implement execution patterns that don't fit the stride model
///
pub trait CustomExecutor: Send {
    /// Run the custom execution loop.
    ///
    /// Called after emulation setup (plugin/EC lifecycle events) and before emulation teardown.
    /// The implementor has full control over how `vcpus` are executed.
