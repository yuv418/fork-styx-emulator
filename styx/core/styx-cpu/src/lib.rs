//! - [`Arch`] (architecture selection)
//! - [`ArchEndian`] (endianness selection)
//! - [`ArchVariant`](arch::backends::ArchVariant) (Architecture sub-family / variant selection)
//!     - Note that each architecture has their own `<ArchName>Variants` struct to import
//!         - eg. arm -> [`styx_cpu::arch::arm::ArmVariants`](crate::arch::arm::ArmVariants)
//! - [`Backend`] (backend executor selection)

//! architectural details of them.
//!
//! By combining the details of the above list you are able to create an operable

//! representative of your target processor / cpu core.
