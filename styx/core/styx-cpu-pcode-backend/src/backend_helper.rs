/// be used to execute P-codes instead of having to write custom logic for every Pcode-based execution
/// backend. It does not handle fetching/decoding P-codes, and the trait's implementation in `execute_single`
/// is expected to call this.
///
/// `BackendHelper` provides a method, `BackendHelper::execute_helper`, that performs
/// all the functionality that `CpuBackend::execute` does. Any `CpuBackend` implementer
/// that wants to take advantage of the common functionality implemented here may simply implement
/// `BackendHelper` and call `BackendHelper::execute_helper` in the implmentation
/// of `CpuBackend::execute`.
///
/// The helper takes in two generics, `ExecuteSingleData` and `PcodesContainer`.
///
/// `ExecuteSingledata` is the return type when execution of a single instruction finishes in
/// `BackendHelper::execute_single`. This is generic as different execution
/// backends may wish to provide different types of data to use when generating
/// the execution report.
///
/// `PcodesContainer` is a container that holds P-codes for different execution backends.
/// The Vec of P-codes passed to `BackendHelper::execute_single` has each element of type `PcodesContainer`.
/// Different backends may choose to hold P-codes differently; the `HexagonPcodeBackend` chooses to set
/// `PcodesContainer` to type `Vec<Pcode>` to have an array of P-codes for each instruction in one larger packet,
/// as `HexagonPcodeBackend` executes packets, not instructions.
///
/// Others may set PodesContainer to type `Pcode`, corresponding to one array of P-codes for one instruction.
///
/// The `BackendHelper::execute_helper` returns the last `ExecuteSingleData` in its
/// `BackendHelperExecuteInfo`, which can be used or discarded in the
