//  - Status Register (sr)
//      - All bits readable, some clearable.
//      - Contains the various USART status flags.
//      - Register values change from software writes and automatic hardware writes.
//      - The flags tracked by this emulation are as follows:
//
//      - - Bit 7 TXE: Transmit data register empty
//      - - - This bit is set by hardware when the content of the TDR register has been transferred into
//      - - - the shift register. An interrupt is generated if the TXEIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. It
//      - - - is cleared by a write to the USART_DR register.
//      - - - - 0: Data is not transferred to the shift register
//      - - - - 1: Data is transferred to the shift register)
//      - - - Note: This bit is used during single buffer transmission.
//
//      - - Bit 6 TC: Transmission complete
//      - - - This bit is set by hardware if the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and if
//      - - - TXE is set. An interrupt is generated if TCIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by
//      - - - a software sequence (a read from the USART_SR register followed by a write to the
//      - - - USART_DR register). The TC bit can also be cleared by writing a '0' to it. This clearing
//      - - - sequence is recommended only for multibuffer communication.
//      - - - - 0: Transmission is not complete
//      - - - - 1: Transmission is complete
//
//      - - Bit 5 RXNE: Read data register not empty
//      - -  - This bit is set by hardware when the content of the RDR shift register has been transferred
//      - -  - to the USART_DR register. An interrupt is generated if RXNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1
//      - -  - register. It is cleared by a read to the USART_DR register. The RXNE flag can also be
//      - -  - cleared by writing a zero to it. This clearing sequence is recommended only for multibuffer
//      - -  - communication.
//      - -  - - 0: Data is not received
//      - -  - - 1: Received data is ready to be read.
//
//      - - Bit 3 ORE: Overrun error
//      - - - This bit is set by hardware when the word currently being received in the shift register is
//      - - - ready to be transferred into the RDR register while RXNE=1. An interrupt is generated if
//      - - - RXNEIE=1 in the USART_CR1 register. It is cleared by a software sequence (an read to the
//      - - - USART_SR register followed by a read to the USART_DR register).
//      - - - - 0: No Overrun error
//      - - - - 1: Overrun error is detected
//      - - - Note: When this bit is set, the RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is
//      - - - overwritten. An interrupt is generated on ORE flag in case of Multi Buffer
//      - - - communication if the EIE bit is set.
//
//      - To see the other flags, see the STM32F405 Technical Reference Manual

//  - Receive Data Register (rdr)
//      - reads
//      - Contains the received data byte.
//      - The data in this register is valid only if the RXNE (Read Data Register Not Empty) bit
//      - in the USART Status Register is set.
//      - If data is received into RDR while RXNE is set, an overrun error interrupt is
//      - generated. The data in RDR is still valid, but the internal shift register the data
//      - was received into is overwritten.
//  - Transmit Data Register (tdr)
//      - writes
//      - This register contains the byte to be transmitted.
//      - Data should only be written to the THR when the TXE (Transmit Data Register Empty) bit of
//      - the USART Status Register is set.
//      - Note that because we abstract over the bit-by-bit transmission of data at the baud rate,
//      - the TXE and TC (Transmission Complete) interrupts will occur at the same time.
//      - If data is written to the tdr before the TXE bit is set, the original data in the tdr
//      - will be overwritten.

//  - Control Register 1 (cr1)
//      - Readable and writable.
//      - Contains various control flags to control the USART/UART behavior
//      - Register values are changed by software.
//      - The flags tracked by this emulation are as follows:
//
//      - - Bit 13 UE: USART/UART Enable
//      - - - When this bit is cleared, the USART prescalers and outputs are stopped and the end of the
//      - - - current byte transfer in order to reduce power consumption. This bit is set and cleared by
//      - - - software.
//      - - - - 0: USART/UART prescaler and outputs disabled.
//      - - - - 1: USART/UART enabled.
//
//      - - Bit 7 TXEIE: TXE interrupt enable
//      - - - This bit is set and cleared by software.
//      - - - - 0: Interrupt is inhibited
//      - - - - 1: An USART interrupt is generated whenever TXE=1 in the USART_SR register
//
//      - - Bit 6 TCIE: Transmission complete interrupt enable
//      - - - This bit is set and cleared by software.
//      - - - - 0: Interrupt is inhibited
//      - - - - 1: An USART interrupt is generated whenever TC=1 in the USART_SR register
//
//      - - Bit 5 RXNEIE: RXNE interrupt enable
//      - - - This bit is set and cleared by software.
//      - - - - 0: Interrupt is inhibited
//      - - - - 1: An USART interrupt is generated whenever ORE=1 or RXNE=1 in the USART_SR
//      - - - - register
//
//      - - Bit 3 TE: Transmitter enable
//      - - - This bit enables the transmitter. It is set and cleared by software.
//      - - - - 0: Transmitter is disabled
//      - - - - 1: Transmitter is enabled
//      - - - Note: During transmission, a “0” pulse on the TE bit (“0” followed by “1”) sends a preamble
//      - - - (idle line) after the current word, except in smartcard mode.
//      - - - When TE is set, there is a 1 bit-time delay before the transmission starts.
//
//      - To see the other flags, see the STM32F405 Technical Reference Manual
