# Examples

These are a set of examples for the `styx-emulator`, feel free to add new benchmarks for new
features as they are added and document what the example is doing so that other people can
benefit from the additions. Enjoy.

.. _using-a-processor:

### Using a Processor

Path: `./using-a-processor`

This is a simple example of using a `Processor`, this example starts a `Processor` and
logs output to the console.

.. _using-processor-hooks:

### Using Processor Hooks

Path: `./using-processor-hooks`

This example creates a `Processor` and adds some hooks to instrument + log the behavior
of the `TargetProgram` at runtime.

.. _working-with-multiple-processors-manually:

### Working with Multiple Processors (Manually)

Path: `./multiple-processors`

This example shows off a manual implementation of multiple communicating `Processor`'s.
Both of these `Processor`'s are taking advantage of `styx-trace` for deep runtime instrumentation,
and connects the two `Processor`'s via `UART`. Note that Neither `Processor` is using the
`ProcessorTracingPlugin`. Both `Processor`'s are in the same process so that plugin would
cause runtime panic due to limitations of Rust `log`+`tracing` crates. To more easily
use multiple processors spawn them in different processes entirely (or use the in-tree
workspaces + utilities for orchestrating emulation execution).

**Where's the TargetProgram's?**  
In transitioning of codebases the `TargetProgram` for each processor was lost, apologies.
Thankfully the code was trivial and `Primary` sent bytes and asserted that they were echoed
by the `TargetProgram` running a UART2~echo server on `Secondary`.

.. _debugging-a-targetprogram-with-gdb-server:

### Debugging a TargetProgram with GDB server

Path: `./debugging-with-gdb`

This example shows how you add the `GdbExecutor` to a `ProcessorBuilder` to debug a `TargetProgram`
under gdb.

.. _kinetis21-angr-interrupt:

### Kinetis21 angr Interrupt

Path: `./kinetis21-interrupt-angr`

This example showcased usage of angr on multiple processors to get through a simple
crackme style challenge that traversed multiple `TargetProgram`'s.

.. _working-with-rawprocessor:

### Working with RawProcessor

Path: `./raw-processor`

This example is to showcase the similarities between the `RawProcessor` and a Unicorn example,
`RawProcessor`'s have no interrupts, and only execute code based on a `ArchitectureVariant`
and a `Backend`.

.. _ppc405-freertos-instrumentation:

### PPC405 FreeRTOS Instrumentation

Path: `./ppc405-freertos-demo`

This example shows the use of a custom tui to instrument + show the progress of the ancient
PPC405 FreeRTOS kitchen-sink style example firmware for the `TargetProgram`.

.. _diy-processor:

### DIY Processor

Path: `./diy-processor`

**NOTE**: this example is not accurate, please see definitions of things like `Stm32f107` in
the repository under `./styx/processors/arm/stm32f107-processor`

This example shows how to make a DIY Processor that you can use standalone, or upstream
to the `styx-emulator` codebase :slight_smile:.

.. _working-with-styx-devices:

### Working with styx-devices

Path: `./styx-devices`

This example shows how you can import and use premade device's and connect them to a
peripheral bus of an emulator.

.. _diy-styx-device:

### DIY styx-device

Path: `./talking-to-peripherals`

This is a DIY device example. Since a device is anything that talks to an emulators'
peripheral bus it start easy (but can quickly balloon) to make your own to suit your needs!

.. _using-the-fuzzer-plugin:

### Using the Fuzzer Plugin

Path: `./fuzzer-plugin`

This example is a end-to-end example of using the `FuzzerPlugin`. This is a complex plugin
that utilizes the `styx-trace` deep instrumentation bus to steer fuzzing based on coverage
reports. This plugin requires some `TargetProgram` pre-processing with an Ghidra script
to produce a usable list of coverage points to measure.

.. _adding-an-external-backend:

### Adding an External Cpu Backend

Path: `./external-backend`

This example showcases creating a custom CPU Backend by implementing the CpuBackend trait.

.. _gdb-multicore-ppc:

### GDB Multi-vCPU (two-core PPC405)

Path: `./gdb-multicore-ppc`

This example demonstrates the Styx GDB plugin against a multi-vCPU target: a
custom two-core PPC405 processor (`DualPpc405Builder`) where each core runs
a tiny counter loop that has one per-core private counter and one shared
counter in memory. Use it to explore `info threads`, per-core breakpoints, and
watchpoints. See the example's own README for the full memory layout of the
firmware/counters and interactive GDB session walkthrough.
